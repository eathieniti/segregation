    "# Schelling Segregation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a random available grid space. While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration of running a Mesa model in an IPython Notebook. The actual model and agent code are implemented in Schelling.py, in the same directory as this notebook. Below, we will import the model class, instantiate it, run it, and plot the time series of the number of happy agents."
